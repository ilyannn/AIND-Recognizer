    "The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models.  In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.\n",

    "The raw data, train, and test sets are pre-defined.  You will derive a variety of feature sets (explored in Part 1), as well as implement three different model selection criterion to determine the optimal number of hidden states for each word model (explored in Part 2). Finally, in Part 3 you will implement the recognizer and compare the effects the different combinations of feature sets and model selection criteria.  \n",

    "So far we have a simple feature set that is enough to get started modeling.  However, we might get better results if we manipulate the raw values a bit more, so we will go ahead and set up some other options now for experimentation later.  For example, we could normalize each speaker's range of motion with grouped statistics using [Pandas stats](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#api-dataframe-stats) functions and [pandas groupby](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html).  Below is an example for finding the means of all speaker subgroups."

By swapping the x and y axes, that discontinuity move to directly above the speaker's head, an area not generally used in signing.\n",

    " I have selected the values that represent the three intervals between the points that are available to us, that is, nose-left hand, nose-right hand and the left-right hand segments. Those values are additionally normalized per-speaker. Note that:\n",
    " \n",
    " - The intervals to the nose are represented only by their lengths. `distn-rn` and `distn-ln` are therefore produced from `polar-rr`, `polar-lr`. The rationale is that to the humans is doesn't seem likely to be important whether the hard is exactly below the nose or a bit off.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The interval between the hands is represented with two coordinate values, `distn-x`, `distn-y`. The rationale is that in a gesture with one hand slightly above the other that fact would be likely noticeable to the observing human. Is is expected that including both coordinates will therefore improve the quality of recognition.\n",
    " \n",
    "If we examine closely the geometry, we see that those 4 values allow us to reconstruct almost completely the 3 points (6 degrees of freedom of those points = 4 values + 2 shifts of the whole picture); any other data would be mostly redundant from the theoretical point of view (but, of course, could be useful in practice). This choice therefore seems reasonable."

    "Now that we have built a training set with sequence data, we can \"train\" models for each word.  As a simple starting example, we train a single word using Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM).   By using the `fit` method during training, the [Baum-Welch Expectation-Maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm) (EM) algorithm is invoked iteratively to find the best estimate for the model *for the number of hidden states specified* from a group of sample seequences. For this example, we *assume* the correct number of hidden states is 3, but that is just a guess.  How do we know what the \"best\" number of states for training is?  We will need to find some model selection technique to choose the best parameter."

In other words, you will write your own classes/functions in the `my_model_selectors.py` module and run them from this notebook:\n",

    "##### Cross-validation folds\n",
    "If we simply score the model with the Log Likelihood calculated from the feature sequences it has been trained on, we should expect that more complex models will have higher likelihoods. However, that doesn't tell us which would have a better likelihood score on unseen data.  The model will likely be overfit as complexity is added.  To estimate which topology model is better using only the training data, we can compare scores using cross-validation.  One technique for cross-validation is to break the training set into \"folds\" and rotate which fold is left out of training.  The \"left out\" fold scored.  This gives us a proxy method of finding the best model to use on \"unseen data\". In the following example, a set of word sequences is broken into three folds using the [scikit-learn Kfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) class object. When you implement `SelectorCV`, you will use this technique."

    "##### Scoring models with other criterion\n",
    "Scoring model topologies with **BIC** balances fit and complexity within the training set for each word.  In the BIC equation, a penalty term penalizes complexity to avoid overfitting, so that it is not necessary to also use cross-validation in the selection process.  There are a number of references on the internet for this criterion.  These [slides](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02433/doc/ch6_slides.pdf) include a formula you may find helpful for your implementation.\n",

    "The advantages of scoring model topologies with **DIC** over BIC are presented by Alain Biem in this [reference](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.58.6208&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (also found [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed3d/7c4a5f607201f3848d4c02dd9ba17c791fc2.pdf)).  DIC scores the discriminant ability of a training set for one word against competing words.  Instead of a penalty term for complexity, it provides a penalty if model liklihoods for non-matching words are too similar to model likelihoods for the correct word in the word set."

For that purpose, the likelihood in the model of generating data from competing classes is also computed and counted against the model.\n",

Experiment with the four feature sets and the three model selection methods (that's 12 possible combinations). You can add and remove cells for experimentation or run the recognizers locally in some other way during your experiments, but retain the results for your discussion.  For submission, you will provide code cells of **only three** interesting combinations for your discussion (see questions below). At least one of these should produce a word error rate of less than 60%, i.e. WER < 0.60 . \n",

    "There are several conclusions that we can make from these experimental results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. That we get the best classification results by using the most features is unsurprising. Of course, having more features increases the amount of resourses necessary for the computation, so this would present an important tradeoff in practice.\n",
    "1. Taken by themselves, `polar` and `ground` feature sets perform the best, while `custom` set does not quite fulfill the high expectations and is located in the middle of the pack. It is easy to explain why the remaning two feature sets have worse results: they doesn't even take into account the nose position.\n",
    "1. There is no single selection method that would be the best choice for all feature sets. Note that from Part 2 we learned that DIC and CV methods took more time to select the model. As predicted, DIC seems to be more suited for the case of many features (where overfitting is less likely) compared to BIC.\n",

    "We have provided in the separate cells the runs details for the specific combinations of \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ground + CV\n",
    "- Custom + BIC\n",
    "- Combined + DIC\n",
    "\n",
    "All of them give the error rate of less than 60%. Examining the mistakes themselves we see that some words, like `JOHN`, are recognized correctly by all of the three, as well as that some videos, like 21, provide a high recognition challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the best method, however, makes guesses that are clearly nonsense, such as `JOHN FUTURE FUTURE BUY HOUSE`. We know that the repetition `FUTURE FUTURE BUY` is very unlikely, but the model doesn't take into account this information. We should be able to improve our accuracy further by taking the context of the words into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we can use the notion of an _n-gram SLM_, where our approach so far was equivalent to a _0-gram SLM_. Saving the data on 1-gram, or even better, bigram, probabilities should already help us to cut down the nonsensical guesses, like `FUTURE FUTURE BUY`, in favor of correct guesses, like `FUTURE NOT BUY`.\n"
